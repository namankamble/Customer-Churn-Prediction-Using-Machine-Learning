<h1 style='cplor:rgb(0,0,58)'>Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
In today's competitive business landscape, retaining customers is crucial for sustaining growth and revenue. Customer churn, the loss of customers to competitors or disengagement from services, can significantly impact profitability and brand reputation. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to predict and mitigate customer churn effectively.
<p>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
<p>
The primary objective is to identify customers at high risk of churning before they terminate their engagement with the service. This involves understanding the factors contributing to churn and developing predictive models to intervene proactively.
<p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
The dataset consists of records from a fictional telecommunications company, encompassing 7043 clients and 20 features including demographic information, subscribed services, and account details.
<p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<ol>
    <li><h5>Data Exploration and Preprocessing:</h5>Detailed examination of the dataset's structure, handling missing values, and preprocessing steps such as data wrangling and outlier detection.
    </li>
<li>
<h5>EDA and Data Visualization:</h5> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies within the dataset using visualization techniques.
</li>
<li>
<h5>Model Deployment:</h5> Deployment of the final predictive model into operational systems for real-time churn prediction and proactive intervention.
